# ***Scopely - Tower Defense***

## **Description**
Although the title states Tower Defense, this is merely a prototype of some Tower Defense mechanics you might encounter in a game. This is a project I made in a few hours when I interviewed at a position for [Scopely](https://www.scopely.com). Although, I did get an offer for the position I applied, at the time, it did not meet everything I was looking for in a company.
